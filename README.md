Free<sub>2</sub>breathe is a hazardous gas detector built using [SPEC sensors](https://www.spec-sensors.com/) and a custom PCB. It detects short-term and long-term hazardous levels of
1. Carbon Monoxide
2. Ozone
3. Sulfur Dioxide
4. Nitrogen Dioxide

and alerts the user if any of these gases are present in concentrations that will cause long-term or short-term harm.
