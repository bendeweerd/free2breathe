### PCB TODO

1. (Done) <s>Determine USB-C connector, get 3d model and footprint</s>
2. (Done, found on SnapEDA)<s>Create a footprint and 3D model for the SPEC sensors</s>
3. (Done, 2-pin JST)<s>Add LED connector</s>
4. (Done) <s>Determine supporting infrastructure for other SPEC sensors</s>
5. (Done) <s>Add SPEC sensors to schematic with infrastructure</s>
6. (Done) <s>Find [alarm](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/pui-audio-inc/AT-1127-ST-2-R/5011397) and add to design</s>
7. (Done) <s>Add power switch</s>
8. (Done) <s>Add status LEDs</s>
9. (Done) <s>Finish sensor biasing</s>
10. (Done) <s>Determine how we want to measure and indicate battery charge state</s>
11. (Done) <s>Determine which LEDs we want, add footprints</s>
12. (Done) <s>Determine where to power the Arduino from</s>
13. (Done) <s>Determine battery footprint (same as switch pad?)</s>
14. (Done) <s>Find female connectors for Arduino</s>
15. Source Transistors
16. (Done, assuming 0603 footprint) <s>Change Power status LEDs to small SMT</s>
17. (Done) <s>Add mounting holes (to ground)</s>
18. Change LED connector from vertical JST (too high) to ?(solder pads)
19. Adjust LED placements for both status and power
20. Place buzzer and LED connector
21. Route traces
