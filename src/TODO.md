### PCB TODO

1. Determine USB-C connector, get 3d model and footprint
2. (Done, found on SnapEDA)<s>Create a footprint and 3D model for the SPEC sensors</s>
3. (Done, 2-pin JST)<s>Add LED connector</s>
4. (Done) <s>Determine supporting infrastructure for other SPEC sensors</s>
5. (Done) <s>Add SPEC sensors to schematic with infrastructure</s>
6. (Done) <s>Find [alarm](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/pui-audio-inc/AT-1127-ST-2-R/5011397) and add to design</s>
7. Add power switch
8. Add status LEDs
9. (Done) <s>Finish sensor biasing</s>
10. Determine how we want to measure and indicate battery charge state
11. Determine which LEDs we want, add footprints 
12. Determine where to power the Arduino from
13. Determine battery footprint (same as switch pad?)
14. Find female connectors for Arduino
15. Source Transistors
