### PCB TODO

1. Determine USB-C connector, get 3d model and footprint
2. (Done, found on SnapEDA)<s>Create a footprint and 3D model for the SPEC sensors</s>
3. (Done, 2-pin JST)<s>Add LED connector</s>
4. (Done, assuming identical biasing setups) <s>Determine supporting infrastructure for other SPEC sensors</s>
5. (Done, assuming identical biasing setups) <s>Add SPEC sensors to schematic with infrastructure</s>
6. (Done) <s>Find [alarm](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/pui-audio-inc/AT-1127-ST-2-R/5011397) and add to design</s>
7. Add power switch
8. Add status LEDs
9.
